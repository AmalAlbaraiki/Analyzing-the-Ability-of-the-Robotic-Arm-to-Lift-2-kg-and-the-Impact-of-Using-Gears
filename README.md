Analyzing the Ability of the Robotic Arm to Lift 2 kg and the Impact of Using Gears
Introduction
In this report, we will discuss whether the motors previously used in the robotic arm can lift 2 kg instead of 1 kg. If the motors are insufficient, we will explore the possibility of using gears to increase the required torque for each joint.

Understanding Torque and Its Importance:

ðŸ”¹ Definition of Torque

Torque is the force required to rotate an object around a specific axis, calculated using the equation:

Ï„=FÃ—d\tau = F \times d

Where:

â€¢	Ï„\tau = Torque (NÂ·m)

â€¢	FF = Applied force (N)

â€¢	dd = Distance from the joint to the point where the force is applied (m)

The applied force FF is derived from the weight of the object being lifted:

F=mÃ—gF = m \times g

Where:

â€¢	mm = Mass (kg)

â€¢	gg = Gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/sÂ²)

Calculating the Required Torque for Each Joint

ðŸ”¹ First Joint (Base Joint)

â€¢	Weight: 2 kg

â€¢	Applied force: F=2Ã—9.81=19.62NF = 2 \times 9.81 = 19.62 N

â€¢	Distance: d=0.15+0.10+0.04=0.29md = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.29 m

â€¢	Required torque: Ï„1=19.62Ã—0.29=5.69â€‰Nâ‹…m\tau_1 = 19.62 \times 0.29 = 5.69 \, N\cdot m

ðŸ”¹ Second Joint (Middle Joint)

â€¢	Weight: 2 kg

â€¢	Applied force: F=19.62NF = 19.62 N

â€¢	Distance: d=0.10+0.04=0.14md = 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.14 m

â€¢	Required torque: Ï„2=19.62Ã—0.14=2.75â€‰Nâ‹…m\tau_2 = 19.62 \times 0.14 = 2.75 \, N\cdot m

ðŸ”¹ Third Joint (Gripper Joint)

â€¢	Weight: 2 kg

â€¢	Applied force: F=19.62NF = 19.62 N

â€¢	Distance: d=0.04md = 0.04 m

â€¢	Required torque: Ï„3=19.62Ã—0.04=0.78â€‰Nâ‹…m\tau_3 = 19.62 \times 0.04 = 0.78 \, N\cdot m

Comparison with Previously Used Motors

If the torque provided by the previously used motors is lower than the calculated values, they will not be able to lift 2 kg, and we will need to improve performance using gears.

How to Use Gears to Increase Torque

If the motor does not provide the required torque, a gear reduction system can be implemented.

ðŸ”¹ Calculating the Required Gear Ratio
The gear ratio is calculated using the equation:
Gear Ratio=Ï„requiredÏ„motorGear\ Ratio = \frac{\tau_{required}}{\tau_{motor}}
For example, if the motor at the first joint provides only 3 NÂ·m, while we need 5.69 NÂ·m:
Gear Ratio=5.693â‰ˆ1.9Gear\ Ratio = \frac{5.69}{3} \approx 1.9
This means that we need a gear reduction of approximately 1:2 (i.e., the motor rotates twice while the arm moves once).

Disadvantages of Using Gears:

ðŸ”´ Reduced speed: Gears decrease speed when increasing torque.

 ðŸ”´ Increased mechanical complexity: Leads to a more complex design and maintenance difficulties.
 
ðŸ”´ Added weight: Gears contribute additional weight to the arm.

 ðŸ”´ Energy loss due to friction: Each gear introduces resistance, leading to some energy loss.

Final Conclusion:

âœ… If the original motors provide the required torque, there is no need for gears.

 âœ… If the motors are insufficient, gears with a 1:2 or 1:3 reduction ratio can be used to increase torque.
 
 âœ… It is important to note that using gears reduces speed and increases mechanical complexity.
